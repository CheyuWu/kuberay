  Validate a KubeRay release candidate against release-test/items.yaml on a local kind cluster: plan
  the Items whose docs changed, run the manifest with the runner, and report what failed and
  why. Use for `/release-test v1.8.0-rc.0` or when asked to run the KubeRay release validation.

# Release test

The argument is the tag under test, for example `v1.8.0-rc.0`. Ask for it if it is missing.

1. **Check the release exists.** `helm repo add kuberay https://ray-project.github.io/kuberay-helm/`,
   `helm repo update`, then `helm search repo kuberay/kuberay-operator --devel --version <tag without v>`
   must list it. If not, stop: there is nothing to test yet.
2. **Plan what changed.** Run `go run ./release-test stale`. If it prints Items, plan them with the
   `release-test-plan` skill, then show `git diff --stat release-test/manifest.yaml` and stop until
   the user has reviewed the diff. Never run units nobody reviewed.
3. **Cluster.** The current kube context must be a kind cluster; create one with
   `kind create cluster --name release-test` if there is none.
4. **Run.** Start `KUBERAY_VERSION=<tag> go run ./release-test run` in the background; it takes hours. It
   skips units whose page changed since they were planned, resumes where it stopped, triages each
   failure with the `release-test-run` skill, and writes `release-test/results/<tag>/SUMMARY.md` at the
   end. Do not poll it; wait for it to exit.
5. **Report.** Read `release-test/results/<tag>/SUMMARY.md` and give the user the Fail table. For each
   `plan-bug`, offer to apply the fix from the report's Triage section to the manifest and re-run the
   Item with `KUBERAY_VERSION=<tag> go run ./release-test run <id>`. Items under Stale go back to step
   2. Never open GitHub issues yourself.
